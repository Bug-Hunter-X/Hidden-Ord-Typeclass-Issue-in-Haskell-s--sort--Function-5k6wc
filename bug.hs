```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code seems straightforward, but it hides a potential issue.  The `sort` function from `Data.List` works by comparing elements. If the elements are not of an Ord instance, this will cause a compile-time error.  For example, if we change `xs` to contain a list of functions, it will fail because functions don't have a natural ordering.

```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [(+1), (*2), subtract 1] -- functions as elements
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
